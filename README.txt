Microsoft TechDays Finland 2012 Demonstrations for T4 and ADM Presentations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Contents to be updated as the demos are uploaded here.

T4 Focused Demos are located below "T4 Demos" and categorized to "Basic" and "Advanced".
All demo directories contain "ReadMe.txt" that briefly summarizes the demos.

Note! Some ADM-abstractions contain ReadMe.txt that has nothing to do with the demos,
this is because of the modular use of abstractions. While the "git submodule" use is
not used in the demos (so that this MSTechDays2012Demos repository is completely independent)
the module-specific ReadMe.txt files are still in place.
